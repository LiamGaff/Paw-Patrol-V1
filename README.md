**Wire Frames**

 The web page was designed using Balsamiq to create some basic wire frames. The design of the page really evolved from the basic wire frames as it came together so the actual website slightly differs from the original designs(Link below).

 [wire frames](wireframes.md)
 

**Colors**

**typography**
 The rest of the web page either 'Oswald', sans-serif or 'Lato', sans-serif were used as the paired nicely with the Lobster and made all the text very visible.

# Testing

<!-- Most of the testing can be found on my TESTING.md document which can be found [here](TESTING.md). -->


## Browser Compatibility Test
Nm | Browser | Action | Test result |
-- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
#1 | Chrome | Open app in browser. |  |
#2 | Firefox | Open app in browser. |  |
#3 | Safari | Open app in browser. |  |


## Deployment

## On GitHub repository
<!-- * Use pip3 to install all modules.

* Create an env.py file and make sure it is listed in your .gitignore file. Input all your important secret variables into this file e.g (API_key, SECRET_KEY, IP, PORT, MONGO_URI, and MONGO_DBNAME.)

* Enter this at the top of your python app file - if os.path.exists("env.py"): import env.

* For each environmental variable, define the variables in the app.py file

* When all the necessary modules are installed and the env.py file is complete, your Requirements.txt file and list all the modules by entering this into the terminal - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

* Create a Procfile that will tell Heroku how to run your app - echo web: python app.py > Procfile

* Git add, commit and push all your changes to the github repository. -->

## Heroku
* Sign in to a Heroku account

* Click on the New button to create a new app with an unused name.

* Next select the app and then click on Settings in the menu.

* Find "Config Vars" section and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.

## How to Fork it
<!-- * log in or Sign Up to GitHub.
* On GitHub, go to []().
* In the top right, click "Fork".
